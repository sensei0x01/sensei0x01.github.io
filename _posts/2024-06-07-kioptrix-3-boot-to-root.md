## üñ•Ô∏èLab Setup

- VMware workstation
- Kali Linux VM
- [Kioptrix Level 3](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-12-3,24/) VM

## ‚¨áÔ∏èInstallation

Download the **".rar"** file from the VulnHub page mentioned above and extract its contents. You will find the following files:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic1.png)

Modify line 10 of the **"KioptrixVM3.vmx"** file from `ethernet0.connectionType = "Bridged"` to `ethernet0.connectionType = "NAT"`.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic2.png)

Next, open the **"KioptrixVM3.vmx"** file using VMware Workstation and power on the machine.

## üîçHost Discovery

After installing the VM, we need to determine the IP address assigned to it. There are many tools available for this purpose; in this article, we'll be using `arp-scan`:

```shell
sudo arp-scan -I eth0 -g 192.168.109.0/24
```

**"192.168.109.0/24"** is the subnet address of the NAT virtual network in my VMware Workstation. It might be different on your device. This command will show all active devices on your network.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic4.png)

From the scanning results, the target IP address is **"192.168.109.141"**. The other active hosts include the VMware default gateway, the DHCP server, and the DNS server.

---

## üïµüèºEnumeration

After identifying the target, we need to scan for open ports and the services running on each of them to understand our attack surface. Nmap is an excellent tool for this purpose.

```shell
target=192.168.109.141
sudo nmap -sS -T4 -p- -sVC -O $target -oN scan-result.txt
```

Let‚Äôs break this command down:
- `sudo`: to run it with root privileges so that we can modify the TCP default connection (Three-way handshake) to make our scan faster.
- `-sS` : for [stealthy scan](https://nmap.org/book/synscan.html)
- `-T4` : for aggressive [timing templates](https://nmap.org/book/performance-timing-templates.html)
- `-p-` : for scanning all ports
- `-sV` : for [service detection](https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html)
- `-sC` : to use [default NSE scripts](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-categories)
- `-O` : [OS detection](https://nmap.org/book/man-os-detection.html)
- `-oN` : save the scan results in **"scan-result.txt"**

Here is the result of the `nmap` scan:

```shell

```

Only two open ports were detected, one of which is HTTP. Let's check the website running on port **80**.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic5.png)

After visiting the Blog page, you will find the following link in the page text: **"http://kioptrix3.com/gallery"**.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic6.png)

If you attempt to visit the page using the IP address, you will encounter the following problem:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic7.png)

To resolve this issue, you need to map the IP address of the machine to the URL **"kioptrix3.com"** by modifying the `/etc/hosts`{: .filepath} file, as shown in the following image:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic8.png)

This can be done using any text editor, but I prefer using Vim.

```shell
sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

Press `i` in `vim` to insert text. When you‚Äôre finished adding your addresses, press `ESC` and type `:wq` to write and quit.

**What was the purpose behind that action?**

>Web servers use the host header (i.e., the website name) that the browser is attempting to contact. The host header is sent regardless of how the IP was resolved. A single web server can host multiple sites on a single IP address and uses the host header to determine which site or content to respond with.
{: .prompt-info }

Certainly! Now, try visiting the page again and see if it resolves correctly.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic9.png)

Nice, it worked! While browsing further, I came across this intriguing page.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic10.png)

The page includes a function that allows users to sort images by ID, name, size, upload date, and views. If you have a strong background in databases, `ORDER BY` should immediately come to mind.

>The `ORDER BY` command is used to sort the result set either in ascending or descending order.
{: .prompt-info }

Assuming that images are stored in a table named 'imgs,' the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM imgs WHERE id = 1 ORDER BY <photoid|filename|filesize|date|views>;
```

To verify our assumption, we need to change the value for the parameter 'id' to a value that could potentially trigger an error in the query. For this purpose, I prefer using one of these characters: `'`, `"`, or `\`.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic11.png)

Bingo! Now we can confirm that this website is indeed using the MySQL database.

**What can we do with this vulnerability?**

>We might find some credentials within the database. To achieve this, we can either craft the commands manually or use 'sqlmap' to automate the process.
{: .prompt-tip }

Another page worth checking is the login page.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic12.png)

**"Proudly Powered by: LotusCMS"** sounds like a hint indeed. Let's search for any CVEs related to that name.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic13.png)

Great, we have an RCE (Remote Code Execution). I‚Äôll keep that in mind because we‚Äôll revisit it later.

---

## üë®üèª‚ÄçüíªExploitation

Now that we've identified an SQL injection vulnerability, we can use `sqlmap` to retrieve some data.

Command:

```shell
sqlmap -u "http://kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=\&sort=filename#photos" -p id --current-user --is-dba --users
```

where:

- `-u <url>` : Traget URL 
- `-p <param_to_test>` : Target parameter
- `--current-user` : Get current user
- `--is-dba` : Check if current user is Admin
- `--users` : Get usernames of DB

The result of this command is.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic14.png)

Next, let's proceed to dump some data from the databases.

Command:

```shell
sqlmap -u "http://kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=\&sort=filename#photos" -p id --dbs #Names of the available databases
```

Output:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic15.png)

The MySQL database is a system database containing tables that store essential information for the MySQL server's operation. Tables in the MySQL database fall into categories such as Grant System Tables. Let's take a look at the tables inside it.

Command:

```shell
sqlmap -u "http://kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=\&sort=filename#photos" -p id --tables -D mysql #Tables of a database ( -D <DB NAME> )
```

Output:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic16.png)

The table we should focus on is `user`. Let's check its columns.

Command:

```shell
sqlmap -u "http://kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=\&sort=filename#photos" -p id -D mysql -T user --columns #Columns of a table  ( -D <DB NAME> -T <TABLE NAME> )
```

Output:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic17.png)

The columns we should focus on are `User` and `Password`. Let's proceed to dump the data from these two columns.

Command:

```shell
sqlmap -u "http://kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=\&sort=filename#photos" -p id -D mysql -T user -C User,Password --dump
```

Output:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic18.png)

After dumping the data from the `user` table, `sqlmap` provides the option to attempt to crack the password hashes.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic19.png)

Unfortunately, our attempt to crack it using the **"rockyou.txt"** wordlist was unsuccessful. We could explore other options, such as using online password-cracking websites like [hashes.com](https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash).

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic20.png)

It worked! We now have the root credentials for the database.

- **root : fuckeyou**

Now, let's take a look at the other database; perhaps we will find some useful data there.

Command:

```shell
sqlmap -u "http://kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=\&sort=filename#photos" -p id --tables -D gallery
```

Output:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic21.png)

We have a table named **"gallarific_users"** that's worth checking.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic22.png)

I'm assuming we're encountering this issue due to our privileges.

**So what should we do next?**

If you're well-versed in PHP and MySQL, you're likely familiar with **"phpMyAdmin"**.

>**"phpMyAdmin"** is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web.
{: .prompt-info }

If you're not an expert, you can apply directory fuzzing on the website to discover these directories. Many tools can accomplish this; I'll use `gobuster`.

Command:

```shell
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -u http://kioptrix3.com 
```

where:

- `dir` : directory/file enumeration mode
- `-w`  : Path to the wordlist
- `-u`  : The target URL

Output:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic23.png)

As shown in the image above, the **"/phpmyadmin/"** directory exists. Let's use the root credentials we've obtained to log in.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic24.png)

Now, we should check the table from which we couldn‚Äôt dump data, which is **"gallarific_users"**.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic25.png)

We've discovered a user named 'admin' with the password **"n0t7t1k4"**. Upon closer inspection, another table that may be useful is **"dev_accounts"**.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic26.png)

Great, we've identified two more users: 'dreg' and 'loneferret'. Their passwords appear to be hashed. I'll attempt to crack them using the same method we used previously.

dreg‚Äôs password:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic27.png)

loneferret‚Äôs password:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic28.png)

Now that we have all these credentials, it's time to gain initial access to the machine. We'll exploit the Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability we discovered on the login page. To do this, I'll use 'msfconsole'. There's a module named 'exploit(multi/http/lcms_php_exec)' designed to exploit this vulnerability.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic29.png)

To execute the module, we need to set the `RHOSTS` and `URI` values.

```shell
set RHOSTS 192.168.109.141 #set the target ip 
set URI / #set target uri 
```

For some reason, the exploitation is not working :/

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic30.png)

Let‚Äôs go back to the webpage. X_X

While thoroughly examining the main page, I noticed a parameter named 'system': `http://kioptrix3.com/index.php?system=Blog`.

It seems like the value of this parameter is passed to the 'include' function in the backend code. Therefore, the backend code will be something like this:

```php
<?php
$system = isset($_GET["system"]) ? $_GET["system"] : "index.php";
$system = $system . ".php";
$file = include("./" . $system);
echo $file;
?>
```

**How can we bypass adding the `.php` part?**

Using a Null Byte (%00) to the file name can terminate the string at the null byte and discard the `.php` extension.

Let's attempt to access the `/etc/passwd`{: .filepath} file by manipulating the `system` parameter. We can achieve this by setting the parameter value to point to the file, like so:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic31.png)

Wow! We have a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability here! Let's check the page source.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic32.png)

Well, after seeing the content of the ‚Äúpasswd‚Äù file we have two options to have a shell on the target.

### Method 1: Log in using SSH

With the credentials we found (dreg and loneferret), we can log in to the target machine. When you try to log in using SSH you will encounter this error:

```shell
Unable to negotiate with 192.168.109.141 port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss
```

The solution for that is using the `-oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss` option, which specifies the host key algorithms the client should consider when connecting to a server.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic33.png)

Nothing interesting was found in Dreg‚Äôs home directory. Let's check Loneferret‚Äôs home directory where we discovered a file named **"CompanyPolicy.README"**. Here is its content:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic34.png)

### Method 2: Upload a web shell file

After extensive searching of the website, I found a directory mentioned in the source code called `/gallery/`{: .filepath}. Within it, there was **"gadmin"**.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic35.png)

After opening this page, I found that it was a login page.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic36.png)

Do you recall the **"admin"** user we discovered in the database? It's time to use it now.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic37.png)

That is exactly what we are seeking for :). Now we need to craft our PHP file. We have a PHP web shell script available by default in Kali.

Copy the PHP web shell script to the current working directory:

```shell
cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php ./
```

Open the file with any text editor, adjust the `IP` and `port` to suit your requirements, and then save the changes.

The final step is to rename the file and change its extension to `.jpg`.

```shell
mv php-reverse-shell.php shell.jpg
```

It's time to upload the file:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic38.png)

Now, run 'nc' in listening mode:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic39.png)

Now, we need to check if the filename remains the same or if it has been changed, along with its location. Click **"view"** to see the image name and path.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic40.png)

After that you will get an error message including the path and name of file which is `/gallery/photos/7vewc51t10.jpg`{: .filepath}.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic41.png)

It is located within the web server directory, which is: `/home/www/kioptrix3.com/`{: .filepath}.

>If you‚Äôre unsure about where this path comes from, let‚Äôs revisit the Local File Inclusion (LFI) part to understand its origin.
{: .prompt-tip }

Now, let‚Äôs concatenate it all together with a null byte and see the magic happen:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic42.png)

## üí•Post-Exploitation

Now that we have access to the target machine, let's revisit the file we found in Loneferret‚Äôs home directory, **"CompanyPolicy.README"**. The message left there was:

```
Hello new employee,
It is company policy here to use our newly installed software for editing, creating and viewing files.
Please use the command 'sudo ht'.
Failure to do so will result in you immediate termination.

DG
CEO
```

From that message, 'sudo ht' seems interesting. Let's run it and see.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic44.png)

Here are four available options: `help`, `open`, `mode`, and `quit`. After checking them, the only useful option appears to be `open`.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic45.png)

Let's check if we can open the sudoers file.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic46.png)

Oh, we are able to access it! How about modifying it? I'll try:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic47.png)

After saving the modifications, let's check our privileges:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-07-kioptrix-3-boot-to-root/pic48.png)

Finally!! ü•≥

This was indeed a challenging machine. I hope this writeup was useful for you folks; stay safe and keep pinging :)
