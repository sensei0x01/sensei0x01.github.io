## üîçHost Discovery

We already know the IP address assigned to this machine from the previous screenshot. However, let‚Äôs assume we don‚Äôt know it. `netdiscover` is a great tool to identify active hosts on your network.

```shell
sudo netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.109.0/24
```

**"192.168.109.0/24"** is the subnet address of the NAT virtual network in my VMware Workstation. It might be different on your device. This command will show all active devices on your network.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic6.png)

As can be seen from the scanning results above, **"192.168.109.149"** is the target IP address. The other active hosts are the DNS server, DHCP server, and the VMware default gateway.

---

## üïµüèºEnumeration

Now that we know the IP address of the target machine, it‚Äôs time to scan the ports to gain a deeper understanding of the attack surface. `nmap` is a very handy tool for this purpose.

```shell
target=192.168.109.149
sudo nmap -sS -T4 -p- -sVC -O $target -oN scan-result.txt
```

Let‚Äôs break this command down:
- `sudo`: to run it with root privileges so that we can modify the TCP default connection (Three-way handshake) to make our scan faster.
- `-sS` : for [stealthy scan](https://nmap.org/book/synscan.html)
- `-T4` : for aggressive [timing templates](https://nmap.org/book/performance-timing-templates.html)
- `-p-` : for scanning all ports
- `-sV` : for [service detection](https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html)
- `-sC` : to use [default NSE scripts](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-categories)
- `-O` : [OS detection](https://nmap.org/book/man-os-detection.html)
- `-oN` : save the scan results in **"scan-result.txt"**

Here is the result of the `nmap` scan:

```shell

From the results above, we have identified only one open port, which is port **80** (HTTP). Additionally, the **robots.txt** file has revealed three directories: `/cola`{: .filepath}, `/sisi`{: .filepath}, and `/beer`{: .filepath}. Let‚Äôs visit them:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic7.png)

I didn‚Äôt find anything but the above picture. So I‚Äôll fuzz for any directory that could be useful. To do this I‚Äôll use `gobuster`:

```shell
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -u http://$target -o site-dir.txt
```

Output:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic8.png)

Let‚Äôs check `/images`{: .filepath} directory and see its content:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic9.png)

The findings are illustrated in the two attached pictures:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic10.png)

Let‚Äôs download them and check their metadata perhaps we will find something useful. I‚Äôll use `exiftool` for this purpose.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic11.png)

After inspecting the metadata without finding anything of interest, I continued investigating and discovered that the word **"fristi"** mentioned in the first picture is actually a directory. Upon visiting it, I found this page:

## üë®üèª‚ÄçüíªExploitation

From the previous section, we have found a login page. Typically, I attempt default credentials on any login page, such as:

- admin: admin
- admin: password

But none of them worked for me. Therefore, I attempted an SQL injection to bypass authentication:

- admin: `' or 1=1-- -`

But unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt work as well. I was always redirected to this page:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic13.png)

Next, I checked the page source hoping to find commented credentials or other helpful information. I discovered something intriguing: the picture used on the login page was base64 decoded, and I found another commented base64 data. Besides that, I found a potential username **"eezeepz"**.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic14.png)

I created a simple HTML page to decode this data and see its content.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Display Image</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src='data:image/png;base64, iVBORw0KGg... <!-- Base64 data -->' />
  </body>
</html>
```

After decoding the data, I found this message:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic15.png)

Initially, I thought it might be trolling, which frustrated me. However, after reconsidering, I wondered if this could be the password. I decided to try it out with the potential username **"eezeepz"**.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic16.png)

Thankfully, the assumption was correct, and I successfully logged in.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic17.png)

After logging in, I discovered an upload functionality, so I attempted to upload a PHP reverse shell code. You can find a PHP reverse shell code preinstalled on Kali Linux at this path: `/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php`{: .filepath}. Remember to modify the IP address and port to suit your requirements before using it. This can be done using any text editor.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic18.png)

There are some validations that we need to bypass. The easiest and most direct way is to add one of these extensions to the file‚Äôs name:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic19.png)

After that, I attempted to upload the file, and it was successful.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic20.png)

Now the file has been successfully uploaded to this path: `/uploads/<file_name>`{: .filepath}. To establish the reverse shell, I needed to run a listener. For this, I used `nc`.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic21.png)

Consequently, I visited the next URL to execute the payload embedded in the uploaded file on the target machine:

```
http://192.168.109.149/fristi/uploads/shell.php.jpg
```

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic22.png)

Bingo! Now that the shell is established, I upgraded it to an interactive shell. This process has been explained in a previous write-up of mine; you can check it out there: [Kioptrix 2: Boot-to-Root](https://sensei0x01.github.io/posts/kioptrix-2-boot-to-root/).

---

## üí•Post-Exploitation

After obtaining an interactive shell, I checked the `/var/www`{: .filepath} directory and found a file named **"notes.txt"**. Its contents were as follows:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic23.png)

After checking the home directory of `/home/eezeepz`{: .filepath}, I found another **"notes.txt"** file that held a message saying:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic24.png)

To clarify, there is a crontab script that runs every minute with admin privileges. This script executes commands from the file `/tmp/runthis`{: .filepath}. The command inside it must start with `/home/admin`{: .filepath}.


The `/home/admin`{: .filepath} directory includes the following 7 binaries: `chmod`, `df`, `cat`, `echo`, `ps`, `grep`, and `egrep`.

So, what I‚Äôll do is insert a command inside `/tmp/runthis`{: .filepath} file to copy the `/bin/bash` binary to `/tmp/bash` using the cat command:

```shell
echo "/home/admin/cat /bin/bash > /tmp/bash" > /tmp/runthis
```

Next, adding the commad that will change the permissions of the copied file to SUID:

```shell
echo "/home/admin/chmod 4777 /tmp/bash" >> /tmp/runthis
```

After waiting for a minute I had a copy with SUID privileges:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic25.png)

Now If I run this binary with the `-p` argument I‚Äôll have admin privileges:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic26.png)

Consequently, I tried to see if I could run any binary with `root` privileges using `sudo -l` but I got asked to enter a password :/

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic27.png)

Since we couldn't check the sudo list, let‚Äôs check `/home/admin`{: .filepath} directory:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic28.png)

As shown in the screenshot above, there are two text files. Let‚Äôs check their content:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic29.png)

It looks like the contents of the text files are encrypted. Let‚Äôs take a look at `cryptpass.py` as it is most likely the script used to encrypt them.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic30.png)

According to the code shown, the function `encodeString` takes a string, applies `base64` encoding, reverses it, and finally applies `rot13` encoding. 

To reverse this process I built the next Python script:

```python
import base64, codecs, sys

def decodeString(encoded_str):
    # Decode the ROT13 encoding
    rot13_decoded = codecs.decode(encoded_str, 'rot13')
    # Reverse the string
    reversed_string = rot13_decoded[::-1]
    # Decode the base64 string
    base64_decoded = base64.b64decode(reversed_string)
    return base64_decoded

if __name__ == "__main__":
    encoded_str = sys.argv[1]
    original_str = decodeString(encoded_str)
    print(original_str.decode('utf-8'))
```

Applying this code on the content of **"whoisyourgodnow.txt"** yielded the password **"LetThereBeFristi!"** Similarly, using the same approach on **"cryptedpass.txt"** gave the password **"thisisalsopw123"**. Based on the file ownership, it is likely that the first password belongs to the user **"fristigod"**, and the second one to the user **"admin"**.

- fristigod : LetThereBeFristi!
- admin : thisisalsopw123

Let‚Äôs log in with **"admin"** and list if there is any command that could be run as `root`.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic31.png)

Since there is no sudo permissions for the user **"admin"** let‚Äôs switch to **"fristigod"**:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic32.png)

From the previous screenshot, there are two points to focus on.
1. User **"fristigod"** can run `doCom` file as `root`.
2. In the last line, the name is shortened to `fristi`.

I‚Äôm going to use the `doCom` file to execute `/bin/bash`, which will grant me root privileges.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic33.png)

Now that we have root privileges, let‚Äôs check the root directory for the flag file.

## ‚ûïBonus

During my enumeration, I found that the Kernel version was vulnerable to [DirtyCow](https://github.com/firefart/dirtycow) and [PERF_EVENTS](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25444) Local Privilege Escalation.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic35.png)

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic36.png)

We have already exploited the PERF_EVENTS In a previous write-up: [Kioptrix 2: Boot-to-Root](https://sensei0x01.github.io/posts/kioptrix-2-boot-to-root/).

This time let‚Äôs try to exploit the DitryCow vulnerability.

### Step 1: Create a simple web server to transfer data

This could be done using Python. Go to the directory where the exploitation code is located and run this command:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic37.png)

### Step 2: Download the exploitation code on victim machine

The command used for this purpose was `wget`. Go to a directory where you have write permission and use this commnad:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic38.png)

### Step 3: Compile the exploitation code

Since the exploitation code is written in `C`, you must compile it uisng `gcc`.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic39.png)

### Step 4: Run the exploitation

Run the exploitation binary and watch the magic!

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2024-06-28-fristileaks-1-3-boot-to-root/pic40.png)

That‚Äôs it for today. I hope this writeup was useful for you folks; stay safe and keep pinging :)
